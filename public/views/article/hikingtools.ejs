                <p><i>Big clunky hiking boots ‚Äì </i>personally, I hate these things.  They cause the same issues with your feet that running in super cushiony shoes do ‚Äì they give too much support and promote an improper foot strike while walking.  On top of that, they are damn heavy.  In my personal opinion, I like to attack hiking differently; however, if you swear by hiking boots and have a $200 pair of Timberlands, I‚Äôm not gonna tell you to chuck them.</p><br>

                <p><i>Sneakers ‚Äì</i> I‚Äôd probably choose boots over regular sneakers when it comes to hiking, as at least the boots are designed specifically for hiking.  However, if sneakers are your only option, lace em up and start your hike.  Just be careful on slipper surfaces as often sneakers won‚Äôt give you the grip you need to get over them.  You can also try barefoot trail running shoes like the Merrell Trail Gloves.  Just make sure your feet are prepared for less. </p><br>

Vibram FiveFingers ‚Äì</i> My vibrams have become my go-to for a shoe while hiking.  Something just feels right about gripping the rocks under my feet while hiking up and down mountain paths.  Now, before you strap on a pair yourself and go for a four-day hike‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been wearing Vibrams for two and a half years or so ‚Äì my ankles and feet and joints have been prepared for strenuous activity.  If you are going to go the ‚Äúbarefoot‚Äù route, start slow, start small, and gradually build up distance and difficulty.  Be comfortable, but be safe.</p>

Socks ‚Äì</i> I‚Äôm usually hiking in my Vibrams without socks so I won‚Äôt claim to be an expert on hiking socks.  If you‚Äôre wearing boots or sneakers, you want to wear socks that aren‚Äôt going to give you blisters or make your feet all sweaty and gross.  Depending on how long the hike is, how serious you are about hiking, and your budget, you can look into super fancy merino-wool socks.  The main issue I found with hiking great distances (before switching to vibrams) was blisters and discomfort in my feet from crappy socks on all-day (7+ hour) hikes.  If you have sock advice, make sure to leave it in the comments.

Pants ‚Äì</i> Don‚Äôt go pantsless through the wilderness ‚Äì best tip I can give you all day.  No, the real advice when it comes to pants/shorts is heavily dependent upon your environment.  If it‚Äôs going to be cold, shorts might keep you shivering.  If it‚Äôs going to be hot, pants might get too uncomfortable.  Only wear jeans if its going to be a comfortable temperature and/or you have no other option ‚Äì being sweaty and hot while wearing jeans sucks.  I‚Äôm a big fan of my nerd pants ‚Äì the Columbia Silver Ridge pants.  Although they look kind of goofy, they‚Äôre incredibly light weight, dry quickly, and can transform from pants to shorts in mere seconds!

When in doubt (or if you are traveling through woods), wear pants. I am horribly allergic to poison ivy, so I like to keep as much of my body covered while hiking to make sure I don‚Äôt get it.  True story: when I was a little kid, I made myself a little bow and arrow (trying to be like Link) and unknowingly feathered my homemade arrows with poison ivy leaves.  When my hands and half of my face swelled up like a balloon from drawing the arrows back across my cheek, I learned my lesson üôÇ

Shirt ‚Äì</i> Intense hike? Wear a performance based shirt like Under Armour or something similar to keep you unsweaty and comfortable.  Although it does have some cotton in it, the Nerd Fitness t-shirt (shameless plug) does hold up quite well to wear and tear over long periods of time ‚Äì I‚Äôve been rocking my shirt in heavy rotation on lots of hikes over the past 10 months in absolute comfort.  You can also wear things like merino wool long shirts and t-shirts which are very light, wick away moisture, hide odors, and breathe well ‚Äì though you will be paying top dollar for them.  If you‚Äôre just starting out, pick an old t-shirt and rock that ‚Äì you can work on optimizing performance once you‚Äôve got a few hikes under your belt.

Jacket ‚Äì</i> I‚Äôve been wearing this Mountain Hardware jacket on most of my hikes and it has been awesome ‚Äì very lightweight so packing it isn‚Äôt a hassle, almost 100% waterproof so it keeps me dry when it rains, and heavy enough to block the wind to keep me warm when it‚Äôs chilly.  Don‚Äôt go out of your way to buy a new jacket if you have a decent wind breaker, but if you‚Äôre going to be doing a lot of hiking or you‚Äôre in the market for a new coat, here‚Äôs my advice: go to a local store and try out all of the jackets until you find one you like.  Once you find the perfect jacket, go home and check online (you can sometimes find the same jacket for up to 60% less) ‚Äì then, ask the local store if they‚Äôll price match or just buy it online.

Hat ‚Äì</i> I‚Äôm usually rocking my Red Sox hat (booo Yankees), but while hiking in Australia I wore a hat with a giant floppy brim to keep my ears and face protected from the sun.  The tops of your ears and back of your neck are highly susceptible to getting burned while on the trail, so either get some sunscreen or wear a hat that keeps them covered.</p>

            Some sort of small backpack</i>  You won‚Äôt be traveling with too much stuff, so you don‚Äôt need to go out and buy a $300 75L ultra backpack.  Any bag that will hold your stuff is sufficient for now ‚Äì if you decide down the road to get super serious about this camping stuff, you can invest money.  Until then though, use what you have or borrow your little sister‚Äôs Dora the Explorer pack.  Wait, don‚Äôt do that.

Make sure your cellphone is fully charged and ready to go ‚Äì</i> a phone can help bail you out in case of emergency, and if you have a smart phone it can multitask as your compass, distance tracker, mapper, and so on.  If you don‚Äôt have a smart phone, bringing a compass or GPS system isn‚Äôt a bad idea (unless it‚Äôs bright and sunny and you‚Äôre good at orienting yourself).  If you‚Äôre a audiophile and need music playing 24/7 like I do, you‚Äôll also need headphones so you can listen to your epic soundtrack (explained later).

A camera ‚Äì </i> Throw a camera in your bag, you never know what you‚Äôll find.  Although I have a camera that I travel with, most of the pictures I‚Äôve been taking recently have been done with my iPhone using apps like Camera+ or ProHDR (which I freaking love).  Both apps are worth the price.  You don‚Äôt need to be a great photographer, just need to capture the moment to look back on fondly as a crotchety old grandpa.  Obviously if you‚Äôre a serious photographer, you‚Äôve already planned to pack your DSLR so I won‚Äôt get into that.

A book ‚Äì </i> I LOVE READING (more than I love lowercase letters), so I always travel with my Kindle on a hike.  Although hiking with friends can be fun, I get a huge thrill out of hiking out to a remote location overlooking a valley or sitting on the edge of a river with a book so that I can spend a few hours getting lost in a story (just finished reading A Dance With Dragons, now moving on to A Wise Man‚Äôs Fear.)

Sunscreen ‚Äì</i> If it‚Äôs sunny outside and you‚Äôre hiking through the woods or up a mountain with a cool breeze in your face, you probably won‚Äôt be able to tell that your ears and face are getting absolutely torched.  Get yourself some 30SPF waterproof sweatproof sunscreen to cover up those ears, cheeks, and back of your neck.
